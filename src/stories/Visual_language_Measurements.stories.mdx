# Meaningful Visual Language

  <p>What should the border radius be for the buttons?</p>
  <p>Should the text be centered or aligned in titles?</p>

<p>
  Nobody cares as long as you‚Äôre just playing around with some nice little UI
  components - probably you've heard of putting some lipstick on a pig. But when
  you are creating a UI to offer structured, information that‚Äôs valuable to the
  users, then it matters. Also, the priority level of the information in itself
  is going to tell you a lot, and helps you create a functional yet aesthetic
  UI.
</p>

<p>
  So, if you don‚Äôt know yet what‚Äôs the key content or the killer feature of your
  application, stop right here, and go find out that now before going any
  further. Do that now.

<div className="subheading">Restricting Frees Resources for Creativity</div>

<p>
  Deciding your measurements upfront helps you make more coherent and
  consistent, eye-pleasing designs, without thinking so much of doing so
  (whoa!), freeing your creative resources to solving deeper, more complex
  problems (whoa whoa whoa!). So, make yourself a favor: restrict your options.
  It will help you (and your team) with making ‚Äúsubjective right decisions‚Äù
  easily in the future, saving time and effort for addressing the real issues.
</p>
<p>
  Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre adding a new element to the web-app, and thinking how much
  padding this element should have around itself. If you limited your right
  options beforehand, this is a no-brainer: you‚Äôve already defined that your
  padding measurements are 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px‚Ä¶, and after testing you end up
  with - 24px, for example. And this decision took 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
  Since many applications are based on text, it‚Äôs a good strategy to start
  dfining measurements by picking your main font (the one used for body text)
  and anchor the rest of the measurements to that. Usually, 16px is a good
  starting point. More on that{" "}

    here.
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the day, there‚Äôs actually quite a few things where you need to
  test and try what‚Äôs best for your case. Operative System (OS) providers have
  made your life easy by providing with their own best practices and standards,
  which you should follow, unless you have a very, very good reason not to.

<div className="subheading">rules of thumb (literally)</div>

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row", height: "580px" }}>
  <div
    style={{
      width: "360px",
      margin: "0 25px 0 0",
      display: "flex",
      flexDirection: "column",
      alignItems: "center",
      backgroundColor: "#faf5fa",
      borderRadius: "5px",
      border: "#c4c4c4",
      padding: "10px",
    }}
  >
    <img
      style={{ height: "540px", width: "180px", borderRadius: "5px" }}
      src={Phone_touch_area_size}
      alt="simplified phone UI with touch area illustrations"
    />
    <span style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }}>
      <strong>Touch area</strong> should be min. 48px by default.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div
    style={{
      width: "360px",
      display: "flex",
      flexDirection: "column",
      alignItems: "center",
      backgroundColor: "#faf5fa",
      borderRadius: "5px",
      border: "#c4c4c4",
      padding: "10px",
    }}
  >
    <img
      style={{ height: "540px", width: "180px", borderRadius: "5px" }}
      src={Phone_thumb_reach}
      alt="simplified phone UI thumb area indications"
    />
    <span>
      <strong>Thumb reaches</strong> comfortably to the bottom and to the middle
      areas.
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Following those two simple rules gets you quite far. Let's elaborate on each a
  bit, and add a few other factors.
</p>
<p>
  Have a minimum of 16px margin on each side. Minimum, since the mobile screen
  is so narrow that you wouldn't probably want to add any more than that
  anyways. Why the 16px? Because that's what both OS providers recommend.
  Following OS rules ensures that your (web) app will work on that platform.
</p>

<div className="subheading">Meaningful sizes</div>

<p>
  Not everything has to follow a perfect 1.2 or 1.25 scaling system just because
  it makes designers‚Äô job easier. You probably have seen tutorials doing that ‚Äì
  but give it a thought!
</p>
<p>
  If you take 16px as the base value, and scale it with 1.2 (or minor third, as
  hipster-dipster designers like to call it), you get font sizes like:
</p>
<p
  style={{
    fontWeight: "800",
    color: "#838383",
    padding: "25px",
    backgroundColor: "#e1e3e5",
    borderRadius: "5px",
  }}
>
  11.111‚Ä¶px, 13.333‚Ä¶px, 16px, 19.2px, 23.04px, 27.648px, 33.1776px, and so
  forth.
</p>
<p>
  Does it <i>really</i> give value to the users, your team or yourself, to have
  the .X sizes? Or could you just use a scale that‚Äôs simple and clean, and
  besides, doesn‚Äôt cause any unexpected behavior in browsers?
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p
  style={{
    fontWeight: "800",
    color: "#838383",
    padding: "25px",
    backgroundColor: "#e1e3e5",
    borderRadius: "5px",
  }}
>
  12px, 14px, 16px, 18px, 24px, 28px, 32px, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
  Clean. Simple. Pretty. These are reasoned and justified, making the whole
  team's life easeier. <strong>Brilliant!</strong>
</p>
<p>
  What's great about this is that you can (an you should) apply the same
  measurements to all of your elements: font sizes, container sizes, paddings,
  margins...

<p>
  Though you have more space on larger screens, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that
  you have to fill the whole page with content.
</p>
<p> Give the content the space it needs. </p>

      A form that is <strong>full screen on mobile...</strong>

      alt="simplified phone UI thumb area indications"
    />
    <span>...doesn't have to stretch on a large screen.</span>
  </div>
</div>

<br />
<p>
  Say you‚Äôre moving from mobile to desktop and have a neat mobile-optimized form
  ‚Äì why would you spread it all over the place?
  <br />
  Also, developers will be happy if you don't invent a new, different layout if
  you don't <i>really need it.</i> Instead, find a solution that makes the
  content smooth to read and interact with.
</p>

<div className="subheading">We love colors</div>
<p>
  It‚Äôs tempting to create a harmonious color palette of five, six colors in
  advance. However, there‚Äôs many reasons why <i>not</i> do that: first of all,
  you‚Äôre likely not going to need that many. But since you defined a palette of
  many tones, you‚Äôre feeling sorry for the colors left un-used.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, start with picking one main color for your application. Once you‚Äôve
  found that, you should add more colors only <i>when you need more.</i> It‚Äôs
  likely that you can make it quite far with just one main brand color, in
  addition to a toned black for text.
</p>
<br />
<p>Why toned black?</p>
<p>Let me ask you this: why would you use #000000? </p>
<br />
<p>
  The pitch black is quite harsh. It makes all other elements appear lighter,
  even worn-out. An intensive, dark black requires more intensive colors around
  it, likely resulting in, well, <strong>intensive</strong> UIs.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, #000000 creates challenges for you in the future: you limit your
  options for no benefit. When the darkest black that exists is already in use,
  you‚Äôre closer to the corner if you‚Äôd someday like to create a dark version of
  your app UI.
</p>
<p>
  However, users aren‚Äôt necessarily going to pay attention nor even notice that
  you‚Äôre using a toned black ‚Äì it will appear as ‚Äòblack‚Äô to them. But there‚Äôs
  several benefits in doing so:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You have a broader palette available: if you need a darker black than your
    toned black, you have it!
  </li>
  <li>Other colors will appear more fresh, vivid and alive.</li>
</ul>
