# Minimum Loveable Product

    ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the harsh truth: People don‚Äôt care about your solution. They care
    about finding the easiest, most convenient, most effective way to meet their
    needs.‚Äù

<p>
  At the beginning, your solution is a hypothesis ‚Äì not a given. When you start
  with delivering customer value, you realize there may be many possible
  solutions to your customers‚Äô problem ‚Äì not just the one you have in mind.

<div className="subheading">Early Validation with The Right people</div>

<p>
  ‚ÄúYou need to find and delight a small early market before you target that
  larger segment. Your odds of succeeding go WAY up when you test your idea with
  a small group of people who need what you‚Äôre offering (Amy Jo Kim).‚Äù Even if
  you‚Äôre creating a product for one large customer, not all the end-users will
  have the same needs, nor will they be interested in the same features - even
  if they work for the same employer.
</p>
<p>
  By targeting a specific, small enough group it‚Äôs easier to deliver a product
  that answers a precise group of users‚Äô needs accurately. Delivering a mediocre
  compromise may give something to everyone, but nobody‚Äôs needs are truly met.
</p>
<p>
  Finding these high-need, high-value early customers is an iterative process
  that you can accelerate by writing down clear, testable hypotheses. Ask
  yourself the following questions:
</p>
<p>
  <i>What group of people will need and want our offering first?</i>
  <br />
  <i>What characteristics and behaviors will they have in common?</i>
</p>
<p>
  And since customers are only interested in solutions that fulfill their needs,
  remember to evaluate:
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    What relevant needs do these customers have right now that we could
    potentially address?
  </i>
  <br />
  <i>How are they currently getting those needs met?</i>
  <br />
  <i>Why is that unsatisfying?</i>
</p>

<p>
  Finding answers to these questions also helps you to find what is the most
  important information to the users (and why). That knowledge will save you
  from many mistakes in the long run: once you know what‚Äôs important, you can
  boldly focus on delivering only that at the beginning, leaving the second
  priority information and functionalities for later. It helps you to avoid
  feature creep ‚Äì trying to add so many ‚Äòwe-need-this-immediately‚Äô things that
  you get nothing done well. Not to mention the legacy design and code that you
  will be rewarded with when trying to implement too much too fast.
</p>

<div className="subheading">Articulate Your Key Assumptions</div>
<p>
  It often helps to write down your hypotheses. Don‚Äôt worry about hitting a
  homerun at the start. The goal of writing down is to articulate your
  hypotheses such that you can rapidly test and iterate them.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Canvas is a handy tool. It helps you and your
  team in crystallizing the essentials: value proposition, core offering and key
  assumptions bare bones, without any decorations. You may have seen something
  that looks similar at first, such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC). However,
  the focus of the BMC is different: it aims at looking at your business in the
  big picture in a more mature stage.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  In the MVP Canvas, you write down assumed early customer group(s), their needs
  that you would like to address, the value proposition, and your solution.
</p>

<img
  src={MVP_canvas}
  alt="partially pre-filled MVP canvas"
  style={{ width: "875px", height: "360px" }}
/>

<p>
  Also notice the ‚Äùearly metrics‚Äù section. In the early stage, you likely don‚Äôt
  have too much data to conduct comparative tests ‚Äì and that‚Äôs ok! However, you
  can choose a subjective metric connected to your product goals. These could
  be:
</p>

<p>
  <i>Preference: do users prefer our old version or new (redesign)</i>
  <br />
  <i>Value: willingness to pay for the product</i>
  <br />
  <i>
    Uptake: willingness to use the product when it still offers a very limited
    selection of features
  </i>

<div className="subheading">Small Product, Big Benefit</div>
<p>
  Re-defining existing software may create pressure to make a lot of changes
  here and there at once. This gets easily very, very overwhelming! Focusing on
  an MVP helps you to avoid designing and planning things too much upfront. Once
  you‚Äôve delivered an MVP, you‚Äôre in a much better position for evaluating both
  your current position as well as your next steps.
</p>

<div className="subheading">Hit a Clear Target</div>
<p>
  Once you and your team have some initial idea of your first users who have a
  burning need that you can answer with your solution, you have something to aim
  at. When your target is clear, it‚Äôs easier to get there. If you realize that
  your assumptions were wrong ‚Äì perfect! You failed early enough! You saved a
  ton of development hours, time, energy and effort when you realized it now.
  Rather than building a product and launching it - only to realize that
  potential customers‚Äô reactions are lukewarm.
